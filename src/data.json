      "I'm a 24-year-old and somehow I ended up developing apps.",
      "Besides writing code, I love being outdoors. Most of the time, you'll find me running in the mountains or wandering around with a huge backpack.",
      "I didn’t plan on becoming a developer - it kind of just happened. Even though... I studied IT in high school, the idea of an outdoor life seemed much more appealing. At university, I ended up living above the Arctic Circle for two years. During those never-ending winter nights, I found myself coding by the glow of my laptop, and here I am today.",
      "I like to keep things simple, whether in my code or in life. A motto that keeps me grounded, whether I’m debugging for hours or running ultramarathons is: \"If you don't fail, you ain't even trying.\""
